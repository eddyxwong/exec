						<h2>What I'll do for CSESoc</h2>
						<h3>Vision for CSESoc</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Over the past 3 years, I’ve gotten so much out of CSESoc, and have personally developed myself through this amazing community.</li>
							<li>Therefore I would love for the opportunity to give back! 2021 has been a rough year but the execs, directors, and subcoms worked super hard to create fun, engaging, and entertaining events in 2021!
							</li>
							<li>I’d to keep the general energy we have, while also having more virtual and digital events in conjunction to running awesome in-person events when we as students return back to campus
							</li>
							<li>Lastly, I’d also like to just further this community as it is a place where we as people can meet new people, learn new things, have fun, and just overall an environment where we can form meaningful relationships!
							</li>
							<li>My vision for CSESoc is that we can maintain and further the current environment, to ensure that CSESoc exists to serve the greater community achieve more of their goals, and always improve based on feedback provided by the community!
