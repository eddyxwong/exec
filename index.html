						<h2>What I'll do for CSESoc</h2>
						<h3>Vision for CSESoc</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Over the past 3 years, I’ve gotten so much out of CSESoc, and I've personally developed myself through this amazing community.</li>
							<li>Therefore I would love for the opportunity to give back! 2021 has been a rough year, but the execs, directors, and subcoms worked super hard to create <b>fun, engaging, and entertaining </b> events in 2021!
							</li>
							<li>I’d like to keep the <b> general energy </b> we have, while also having <b> more virtual and in-person events</b> when we eventually return back to campus
							</li>
							<li>I’d like to just <b> further this community </b> as it is a place where we as people can <b> meet new people, learn new things, have fun, and just overall an environment where we can form meaningful relationships!</b>
							</li>
							<li>I'd like to ensure, <b> that CSESoc continues to exist</b>, to serve the greater community achieve more of their goals, and always improve based on feedback provided by the community!
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Goals for 2022</h3>
						<h4 class="minor-header">General</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Maintain and further the CSESoc’s discord server as it is currently a place where students and course admins can have discussions and have <b>fun social times</b></li>
							<li><b>Actively facilitating conversations and event suggestions</b> with the broader CSE community as CSESoc exists to serve the community!</li>
							<li><b>Provide more efficient and effective frameworks</b> and processes for the director and exec team to work with so we can <b> provide an even better experience externally</b></li>
							<li>While also ensuring the internal subcom <b> does not suffer from excessive burnout and an overload of work! </b></li>
						</ul>
						<h4 class="minor-header">Professional</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Host at least one coding competition or capture the flag event every semester both online and in-person</b>, in collaboration with industry partners and other societies! These have been very popular and will continue to be even more popular as the community grows due to our desire to always make things, meet new people and have fun!</li>
							<li><b>Prioritizing the self-development </b>of our community and providing professional self-development workshops along with <b> LinkedIn photoshoots</b> to get the community <b>ready for the intern application season</b> and <b>increasing their chances </b>of getting dev-related jobs!
							</li>
							<li>Run more events where students can get <b>resume, personal project and portfolio feedback </b>to help them get their next job!
							</li>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 class="minor-header">Social</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Run larger and diverse events</b> where we can provide a much more entertaining and fun uni experience, virtually and in person. <b>- Lets go bouldering or do virtual workouts.</b>
							</li>
							<li>Cohost with rising and/or established societies so we can capture a more diverse range of the community and <b> provide more value to the broader engineering community. </b>
							</li>
							<li><b>Produce more fun and informative content</b> on our Tiktok, Youtube and Twitch accounts! 
							</li>
							<li>Improve and expand on the <b>wellness initiatives </b>we currently have (eg. wellness posts on Instagram) as it is through a balanced lifestyle and good habits that we can do our best work! And live our best lives!
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4 class="minor-header">Academic</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide more <b> study environments for our broader community</b>, as we’re all trying to get that HD, and why not do that with mates!
							</li>
							<li><b>Promote and maintain the upcoming course review website </b>to allow students to find more about their upcoming courses!
							</li>
							<li><b>Improve access and distribution of resources regarding essential CSE tools for uni and industry</b>, so students can get familiar and have less stress when dealing with their last minute labs!
