						<h2>What I'll do for CSESoc</h2>
						<h3>Vision for CSESoc</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Over the past 3 years, I’ve gotten so much out of CSESoc, and have personally developed myself through this amazing community.</li>
							<li>Therefore I would love for the opportunity to give back! 2021 has been a rough year but the execs, directors, and subcoms worked super hard to create fun, engaging, and entertaining events in 2021!
							</li>
							<li>I’d to keep the general energy we have, while also having more virtual and digital events in conjunction to running awesome in-person events when we as students return back to campus
							</li>
							<li>Lastly, I’d also like to just further this community as it is a place where we as people can meet new people, learn new things, have fun, and just overall an environment where we can form meaningful relationships!
							</li>
							<li>My vision for CSESoc is that we can maintain and further the current environment, to ensure that CSESoc exists to serve the greater community achieve more of their goals, and always improve based on feedback provided by the community!
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Goals for 2022</h3>
						<h4>General</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Maintain and further the CSESoc’s discord server as it is currently a place where students and course admins can have discussions and have fun social times</li>
							<li>Actively facilitating conversations and event suggestions with the broader CSE community as CSESoc exists to serve the community!</li>
							<li>Provide more efficient and effective frameworks and processes for the director and exec team to work with so we can provide an even better experience externally</li>
							<li>While also ensuring the internal community does not suffer from excessive burnout and an overload of work!</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Professional</h4>
						<ul>
							<li> Host at least one coding competition or capture the flag event every semester both online and in-person, in collaboration with industry partners and other societies! These have been very popular and will continue to be even more popular as the community grows due to our desire to always make things, meet new people and have fun!</li>
							<li>Prioritizing the self-development of our community and providing professional self-development workshops along with LinkedIn photoshoots to get the community ready for the intern application season and increasing their chances of getting dev-related jobs!</li>
